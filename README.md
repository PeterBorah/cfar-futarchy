**Hanson's Hand**
is an application for implementing **futarchies**, designed for approachability and ease of use over theoretically optimal economics. We encourage its use in rationalist group houses and experimental seasteads.

### Futarchy summary

Futarchy is a system of governance, invented by economist Robin Hanson, that attempts to solve democracy's failure to aggregate accurate information from an electorate by instead extracting information from prediction markets. Constituents "vote on values" — democracy remains in place to fairly determine an electorate's ideal utility function — and "bet on beliefs" — the results of open prediction markets, measured against the chosen utility function, determine policy. The consequence of monetary gain or loss incentivizes "experts" to direct the markets, and thus policy and policy effects, towards an "ideal" state.

Futarchic policymaking begins when the nation-state (or any kind of hierarchical decision-making entity) sponsors a nationwide vote to determine the outcome its citizens want to improve. This value should be a measure of utility, such as GDP per capita or environmental progress — or a combination of metrics. 

After a utility function is determined, parallel conditional prediction markets are created for each policy believed to improve the metric. For example, if the metric chosen by the people is GDP per capita, each policy market would consist of two options — a token in support of the policy and a token in opposition to the policy. Those with confidence in their beliefs would purchase the respective token reflecting their beliefs, thus increasing price of the token in question. As participation increases, the resulting price of each token would be a crowdsourced prediction of the decision's effect on GDP per capita. In the case that the markets become detached from reality, those more or better informed will have the financial incentive to provide their knowledge in the form of purchasing undervalued tokens, thus driving up the correct token's price and correcting the inconsistency.

Once a predetermined length of time has elapsed, the policy tied to the token with the highest price is selected to be implemented, i.e. determined "lawful" (depending on the policy, enforcement may be left to existing centralized processes). The tokens whose policies are not realized will have all their market transactions voided. Finally, the eventual impact of the policy implemented (across a fixed length of time) will be used to determine compensation for holders of the remaining valid tokens.

Such a system could be scaled down to the enterprise level to optimize policymaking and provide stockholders and employees with a voice in management.


### Why blockchain?

Prediction markets and futarchy are active interest areas among researchers and developers of blockchain technology — a.k.a. the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses a consensus mechanism to validate and canonicalize its transactions among decentralized peers. Blockchain technology allows prediction markets to have immutable and unbiased transaction ledgers and oracles, ensuring that payouts and outcome reports are correct, without needing to compensate supposedly trustworthy middlemen and central managers. Your trust lies entirely in the code, which is typically open source in order for public participation in consensus.

Hanson's Hand is built on Ethereum, a popular cryptocurrency system like Bitcoin, as well as a platform for developing decentralized applications via writing and running smart contracts. Blockchain-based smart contracts are pieces of software that encode, allow users to interact with, and enforce, arbitrary rules regarding ownership and transaction of the blockchain's asset. They are written in Ethereum's built-in programming language, whose Turing-completness allows smart contracts to perform any computation — which Bitcoin scripting lacks. As you may see, the creation and facilitation of prediction markets can easily be mapped onto Ethereum smart contracts.

### Enterprises and polities

The little futarchy research that has been done heretofore has mostly been regarding its application onto enterprises (mostly blockchain companies) in order to affect decisionmaking that optimizes its profit and its product (e.g. its blockchain system), with research culminating in the ideal of the "futarchic DAO" — or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, typically a blockchain service or company whose governance (method to update protocol and software) is also blockchain-based, rendering the entire company permanently autonomous.

Hanson's Hand aims to bring futarchic governance to on-the-ground political entities, communities of people, typically geographically connected, living under a single political system. This ranges from the large — nations, international alliances — to the small — seasteads, communal houses. (Seasteads typically operate outside of national jurisdictions. Communal house residents are typically subject to local and national laws — but for our purposes, house "governments" are isolated and accessible enough to be a good starting-place for political futarchies.)
